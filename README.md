# Active_Recall_Pro (This is a stand-in name)
 A flashcard web app project.
## GOAL:
The immediate goal is to create a flash card application that allows users to log in, create multimedia flash cards, edit flash cards, delete flash cards, and study flash cards. The long term plan is to add a social feature that would allow users to make decks public (so that they may be seen and studied by other users) or private (so that only the creator can see the deck and its cards). I also hope to add a version control feature similar to Git for flashcard decks. This would allow users to copy a public deck to their profile and modify it, or to collaborate on decks using a Git-like branch structure. Tracking stats on who creates popular decks (meaning decks that are studied, copied, and branched often) could allow a ranking or reward system to benefit power-users. Features such as a heat map for studying similar to anki or GitHub, and time view (a view of a deck arranged for studying based on the week of a class one is in) are also possible. Most importantly, users own their cards and they will be saved to the userâ€™s machine to be synced to the site later.
